# distracted_driver_detection
Work done during the Research Project INSECTT (https://www.insectt.eu). 

# Challenge 
This code was mainly done for training a computer vision model to detect distracted drivers on images. A Kaggle challenge, the Statefarm Distracted Driver,
made an available dataset of images (https://www.kaggle.com/c/state-farm-distracted-driver-detection). 
The code in this repo, is a collection of computer vision practices where a pretrained model can be tuned by using different strategies such as:
data augmentation, sampling techniques, mixup and classweighting.
